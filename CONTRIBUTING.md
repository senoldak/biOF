## Contribution Workflow

1. **Create a Feature Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/my-new-feature
   ```
2. **Follow Coding Standards**:
   - Write clean, type-annotated Python (`typing` and modern Python 3.10+ syntax).
   - Use asynchronous programming patterns (`async`/`await`) for I/O operations and database queries.
   - Follow PEP 8 style conventions.
   - Ensure all user-facing strings, comments, and documentation are written in clear, professional English.
3. **Write and Run Automated Tests**:
   - Add unit or integration tests in `tests/` for any new logic, endpoints, or collector features.
   - Verify that all tests pass locally before opening a pull request:
     ```bash
     pytest -v --cov=bioseeder
     ```
4. **Commit Your Changes**:
   - Use descriptive commit messages following the Conventional Commits specification:
     - `feat: add new regulatory designation boost`
     - `fix: correct clinical trial completion date parser`
     - `docs: update quick start instructions`
5. **Open a Pull Request**:
   - Push your branch to GitHub and submit a Pull Request targeting the `main` branch.
   - Describe what changed and why, linking any relevant issues.

## Architecture & Code Guidelines

- **ORM & Database**:
  All database models inherit from `bioseeder.database.Base` and use SQLAlchemy 2.0 `Mapped[...]` attributes. Ensure foreign keys specify cascade behaviors appropriately.
- **Scoring Engine**:
  Quantitative scoring functions in `bioseeder.engine` must remain mathematically bounded between $0.0$ and $100.0$, handling `None` or `NaN` inputs gracefully.
- **Data Collectors**:
  All upstream collectors in `bioseeder.collectors` must inherit from `BaseCollector` to respect rate limits and implement exponential backoff with jitter.
- **Frontend**:
  The Dark Cyber-Biotech Terminal UI uses vanilla ES6, CSS variables (`tokens.css`), and semantic HTML5 without Node.js dependencies. Always escape dynamic user and API values using `escapeHtml()`.
